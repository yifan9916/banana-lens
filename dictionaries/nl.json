      "04": "My main cameras are the Sony A7IV and the iPhone 15 Pro Max. üì∑üì±",
      "05": "I have two lenses: an 85mm telephoto and a 20mm wide-angle lens. I've mostly used the 85mm-love the depth of field, but lately, I've realized some of my favorite shots are with the 20mm.",
      "06": "I edit all my photos in Lightroom and finish in Photoshop, adding some blur and hallation. I focus on color and grading, keeping scenes as accurate as possible‚Äîno AI, and rarely any spot edits. üé®",
      "07": "I haven't added presets to my workflow yet, so editing a new batch of photos still takes quite some time."
