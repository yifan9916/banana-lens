      "02": "I enjoy 'messy' shots or 'dirtying the frame' as professionals call it. Shots that tell a whole story in a single frame are my favorite.",
      "03": "I've been very picky about this—too picky, actually. I'm working on just taking more shots, trying different things. You never know which ones might inspire you later! ✨",
      "04": "My main cameras are the Sony A7IV and the iPhone 15 Pro Max. 📷📱",
      "05": "I have two lenses: an 85mm telephoto and a 20mm wide-angle lens. I've mostly used the 85mm-love the depth of field, but lately, I've realized some of my favorite shots are with the 20mm.",
      "06": "I edit all my photos in Lightroom and finish in Photoshop, adding some blur and hallation. I focus on color and grading, keeping scenes as accurate as possible—no AI, and rarely any spot edits. 🎨",
      "07": "I haven't added presets to my workflow yet, so editing a new batch of photos still takes quite some time."
