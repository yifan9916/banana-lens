          "04": "Its towering structures and waterfront views reminded me a lot of Hong Kong, but with everything way bigger and brighter, less cosmopolitan but with a bolder, more indigenous feel.",

          "06": "It turns out that Chungking Mansions, a historic hub in Hong Kong, shares a connection with Chong Qing's history as a wartime capital. Its name apparently originated from the influx of people who converged in the area during and after the Japanese invasion. This iconic building would then be immortalized in Wong Kar Wai's famous 'Chungking Express'."
